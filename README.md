# Chatbot Using NLTK and Machine Learning

This project implements a simple chatbot using NLTK for text preprocessing and a trained model for responding to user input. The chatbot processes user queries, cleans the text, and provides relevant responses based on the trained data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and case normalization using NLTK.
- **Interactive Chat**: Allows users to input text and receive meaningful responses.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures NLTK resources are downloaded and any missing components are handled gracefully.

## Files
1. **`train.py`**: Script for training the chatbot model with pre-defined intents.
2. **`test.py`**: Script for testing and interacting with the chatbot.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - NLTK
  - NumPy
  - TensorFlow (if using a neural network-based model)
